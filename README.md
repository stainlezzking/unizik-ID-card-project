## IT PROJECT
This is my IT project which i built to solve a huge problem in the school, in the area of student identity.
During my defence, everyone loved this project including internal and external supervisors and the student for the problem it solves effortlessly, which resulted in me being awarded an A+

### Motivation for this project

As of 2021 in Nnamdi Azikiwe University, less than 30% of the students had the school's ID card for the reason that thousands of students were being admitted each year
and it was too much workload for a couple of staff to design using softwares like Corel draw. This project 
was therefore a solution to ease the workload of the staffs and it also solves the issue of validating the authenticity of the ID card.
 

## what this project solves

#### It Eliminates the issue of fogery > 

When a user signs up, his information is backed up to the database, and there is a page where 
you can authenticate the legitimacy of the ID's source on the application, this feature ofcourse
is only pertinent if access is only given to verified users by the school.

### It Eases the work load of staffs >
The workload of manually editing and printing ID cards of thousands of students by a few numbers of staffs has been cut by a huge percentage

### The cost of editing
The cost of getting an ID card used to be the sum of the editing and printing cost. Now that the editing is done automatically on the application it means the student would no longer need to pay the cost of editing, and for some who own a printer at home, it's no cost, 100% slash in price :)

### cofirmation of student status
This could now be used by the authorities or family members to validate your student's status, as authorities like the police who do not have an easy way of validating an ID can now go on the platform and scan the bar code or search using the reg number to see the studen's status
